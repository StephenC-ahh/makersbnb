Reflection on Engineering Project I - MakersBNB🏡

During this week, we have worked in teams to build a program according to a specification to create a clone of Airbnb.


📤  Throughout the week we have broken down different specification requirements into manageable tasks that were then assigned to pairs to work on.

🤝  We were able to work in an agile worflow by using trello.com to view our product backlog, decide on tickets and work with pairs to achieve set tasks. 

⏰  We have scheduled regular agile working ceremonies to check in with each other and communicate our plans and reflect on how our day has been.

💭  We focused hugely on XP values which are; simplicity, communication, feedback, respect and courage whilst working as a group.

🚦  We have followed the full developer git workflow of branching, reviewing and merging.

🗣  We were able to give and receive meaningful code review.
